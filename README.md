# Tempesta FW


### What it is?

**Tempesta FW** is a hybrid solution that combines a reverse proxy and
a firewall at the same time. It accelerates Web applications and protects
them against DDoS attacks and Web application attacks.

**Tempesta FW** is built into Linux TCP/IP stack for better and more stable
performance characteristics in comparison with TCP servers on top of common
Socket API or even kernel sockets.

We do our best to keep the kernel modifications as small as possible. Current
[patch](https://github.com/tempesta-tech/tempesta/blob/master/linux-4.9.35.patch)
is just about 2,000 lines.
