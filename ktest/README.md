## Tempesta Kernel Emulation Unit Testing Framework

This is just a set of C headers with the same names and directory hierarchies
as in Linux kernel plus some additional helpers. This headers provide only most
usable stubs for real kernel headers, so small and kernel modules can be
compiled and tested in user space.

See usage example in tmepesta\_db/t/tdb\_htrie.c.
