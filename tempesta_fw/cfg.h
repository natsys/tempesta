/**
 * TfwCfgEntry represents a single parsed entry in a configuration file.
 *
 * Consider this raw configuration example:
 *     server example.com {
 *         listen 10.0.0.1:80 192.168.0.1:80 :8080 proto=http;
 *         listen :443 [::0]:443 proto=https;
 *     }
 * This is not a real configuration, but it is synthetically valid, and if you
 * parse it, the parser will produce the following three entries:
 *  1. TfwCfgEntry {
 *         .name = "server",
 *         .val_n = 1,
 *         .vals = { "example.com" }
 *         .have_children = true
 *     }
 *  2. TfwCfgEntry {
 *         .name = "listen",
 *         .val_n = 3,
 *         .vals = { "10.0.0.1:80", "192.168.0.1:80", ":8080" },
 *         .attr_n = 1,
 *         .attrs = { { .key="proto", .val="http" } },
 *         .have_children = false
 *     }
 *  3. TfwCfgEntry {
 *         .name = "listen",
 *         .val_n = 2,
 *         .vals = { ":443", "[::0]:443" },
 *         .attr_n = 1,
 *         .attrs = { { .key="proto", .val="https" } },
 *         .have_children = false
 *     }
 *
 * Both sections and directives are expressed by the TfwCfgEntry structure.
 * The difference is only in the @have_children flag which is true for sections.
 *
 * Generally this is a temporary structure that lives only during the parsing
 * and acts as an interface between the parser FSM and TfwCfgSpec->handler.
 * The parser accumulates data in the TfwCfgEntry, and when the current entry is
 * finished, the parser executes the handler and then destroys the structure.
 *
 * @line_no	- Current line number, used to show propper config parsing error
 *		  to user.
 * @line	- Pointer to start of the current line, for same purpose.

/**
 * TfwCfgSpec is a single instruction for the configuration parser.
 * It specifies a @handler which is executed when the parser mets an entry with
 * the given @name.
 *
 * @name is the key for matching with TfwCfgEntry->name. Usually you provide an
 * array of TfwCfgSpec structures to the parser, and it searches for a matching
 * one for every parsed configuration entry.
 *
 * @deflt is a default value which is used when the configuration file contains
 * no matching entries. In this case the field is parsed into a fake TfwCfgEntry
 * object and pushed to the @handler in the same way as if it was a part of a
 * real configuration file. That is awkward for simple data types like integers
 * or booleans, but beneficial for complex ones like IP addresses and strings
 * where handler functions allocate memory.
 *
 * @handler is a callback function which is responsible for:
 *  1. Serializing strings into native data types.
 *     We don't make the parser bloated by handling all sorts of data types in
 *     there. Instead, we do only basic syntax parsing and leave rest of the job
 *     to the @handler. You choose an appropriate handler function that converts
 *     string to a desired type (int, bool, TfwAddr, etc); or you can implement
 *     your own handler without augmenting the parser, so this is flexible.
 *  2. Copying strings from TfwCfgEntry to some storage.
 *     The TfwCfgEntry is destroyed after the @handler returns, so you can't
 *     save pointers and you have to copy strings located in there. Usually you
 *     don't want strings, or you prefer to store them in a more efficient way,
 *     so we don't complicate things here with reference counters.
 *
 * @dest and @spec_ext are "arguments" used by the @handler.
 * Each handler function has its own types of these arguments.
 * Usually @dest is a destination object which is modified by the @handler,
 * and @spec_ext is a spec extension like TfwCfgSpecInt that contains some
 * constraints like minimum/maximum values,
 * WARNING: no type checking. You have to check carefully that these fields are
 * what @handler desires, or you get a memory corruption.
 *
 * @call_counter is how many times the @handler was invoked during the parsing
 * process. It is used by the parser to determine whether it needs to process
 * the @deflt field. The counter is reset when configuration is re-loaded.
 *
 * @cleanup is another callback which is supposed to free memory allocated
 * by the @handler. It is called when the configuration is un-loaded (either the
 * system is stopped, or new configuration is available, or an error occurred).
 * The @cleanup callback is invoked when @handler was called at least once
 * regardless of the handler's return value.
 *
 * Configuration specification may have nested entries. In that case @handler
 * must be filled with pointer to function @tfw_cfg_handle_children(),
 * @dest - null-terminated array of nested specifications, @spec_ext -
 * poitner to instance of @TfwCfgSpecChild struct. @cleanup function cleaning
 * specification and all the nested entries is a mandatory in this case.
 * Generic @tfw_cfg_cleanup_children() function calls @cleanup functions for all
 * the nested entries and may be used here. Or user-defined function may be
 * provided, if so it takes responsibility to clean up all the nested entries.
 *
 * Note: There is special case of repeatable specifications containing
 * non-repeatable nested entries. Such entries need @call_counter values
 * of non-repeatable child entries to be reset before using specs in the
 * configuration parser. That breaks generic @cleanup approach based on
 * @call_counter values, so reset will take place only if user-defined cleanup
 * function is provided.
