[General]
# This section refer to testing framework itself.

# Verbose level:
# 0 - quiet mode, result of each test is shown by symbols:
#   `.` - passed,
#   `F` - failed,
#   `u` - unexpected success,
#   `x` - expected failure.
#   `s` - skipped;
# 1 - Show test names;
# 2 - Show tests names and performance counters;
# 3 - Full debug output.
#
# ex.: verbose = 2 (default 0)
#
verbose = 1

# Duration of every single test involving HTTP benchmarks utilities, in seconds.
# Use small values to obtain results quickly add large for more heavy stress
# tests. Default is 10 seconds.
#
# ex.: duration = 60 (default 10)
#
duration = 10

# Number of concurrent connections for HTTP benchmarks utilities.
# Larger values stress TempestaFW better, but require more resources.
#
# ex.: concurrent_connections = 10 (default 10)
#
concurrent_connections = 10


[Client]
# Configuration for HTTP clients.

# Binaries of utilities used for testing. Must be present in PATH or
# absolute paths must be given.

# Apache Benchmark binary.
#
# ex.: ab = /usr/bin/ab (default ab)
#
ab = ab

# wrk benchmark utility.
#
# ex.: wrk = /home/user/wrk/wrk (default wrk)
#
wrk = wrk

# Siege benchmark utility.
#
# ex.: siege = /usr/bin/siege (default siege)
#
siege = /usr/bin/siege


[Tempesta]
# Configuration for the host running TempesaFW. Host may be remote or local
# one. Refer to Readmi.md for more information.

# IPv4/IPv6 address of interface used for testing. This value will be used
# as a parameter in commands or configuration files.
#
# ex.: ip = 192.168.11.6 (default 127.0.0.1)
#
ip = 127.0.0.1

# Target host description. Host can be remote or local one. Remote hosts are
# controlled via SSH protocol.
#
# ex.: Use remote host to run TempestaFW:
#       hostname = tempesta.test  (default localhost)
#       user = rtest              (default root)
#       port = 22022              (default 22)
#
# ex.: Use the local host to run HTTP clients (default):
#       hostname = localhost
#
hostname = localhost

# Absolute path to TempestaFW sources directory.
#
# ex.: workdir = /home/user/tempesta (default /root/tempesta)
#
workdir = /root/tempesta


[Server]
# Configuration for the host running HTTP servers. Host may be remote or local
# one. Refer to Readmi.md for more information.

# IPv4/IPv6 address of interface used for testing. This value will be used
# as a parameter in commands or configuration files.
#
# ex.: ip = 192.168.11.7 (default 127.0.0.1)
#
ip = 127.0.0.1

# Target host description. Host can be remote or local one. Remote hosts are
# controlled via SSH protocol.
#
# ex.: Use remote host to run HTTP servers:
#       hostname = remote.com   (default localhost)
#       user = rtest            (default root)
#       port = 22022            (default 22)
#
# ex.: Use the local host to run HTTP clients (default):
#       hostname = localhost
#
hostname = localhost

# NGINX binary. Must be present in PATH or absolute path must be given.
#
# ex.: nginx = /usr/bin/nginx (default nginx)
#
nginx = nginx

# Absolute path to sample HTTP root location. Must be reachable by nginx.
#
# ex.: resources = /usr/share/nginx/http/ (default /var/www/html/)
#
resources = /var/www/html/
