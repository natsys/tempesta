 * sum of the series containg the server also decrements, i.e. decreases for
 * 1.
 *
 * Thus, a user must not specify weights like {1000, 100} since decrement
 * doesn't affect the sum of series. Instead, they must specify the weights
 * as {10, 1}. Both the cases will distribute requests proportional to the
 * specified wights on large numbers, but significant bursts are possible in
 * the first case.
 *
 * Dynamic weights must be adjusted by devision for minimal weight. The same
 * can be done for static weights. Or at least document the algorithm
 * peculiarity for a user.
