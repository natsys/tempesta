 * HTTP FSM states.
 *
 * We (as Apache HTTP Server and other Web-servers do) define several phases
 * on HTTP messgas processing. However we set the hooks also to response
 * processing (local and received from backend server) as well as to request
 * processing. We can depict the phases as following:
 *
 *	Client			Tempesta			Server
 *	~~~~~~			~~~~~~~~			~~~~~~
 *
 * 	[req]		-->	(I) (process)	-->		[req]
 *
 * 	[resp]		<--	(process) (II)	<--		[resp]
 *
 * 	[resp]		<--	(III) (process) <-+
 * 						   \
 * 						(local cache)
 *
 * So generally hooks are called on receiving client request (I), on receiving
 * server response (II) and after generation of local response (III).
 *
 * TODO generic callback note: Nginx uses chains for filters, so all filters
 * is called each time regardless neither of them are activated.
 * Only conf->enable for each filter is verified. So we need to:
 * 1. store all callbacks in fixed size array to eliminate random memory access
 *    on callbacks;
 * 2. modules must register a callback only if it has work to do (not just when
 *    it's loaded into kernel).
