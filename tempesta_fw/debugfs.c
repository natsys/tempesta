/**
 * Create a file in debugfs and bind a function with it.
 *
 * @path  Path to of a file to be created.
 *        The path is always treated as relative to tempesta root directory
 *        in the debugfs. The file may exist, in this case it will be replaced.
 *        Parent directories may not exist (they will be created automatically).
 * @fn    A function that handles I/O (that is either receives or sends data to
 *        user-space).
 *
 * This function allows to bind a file (that may be read/written in user-space)
 * with a function (that works in kernel-space).
 *
 * Consider the following example:
 *
 * int my_io_handler(bool is_input, char *buf, size_t size)
 * {
 *         if (is_input) {
 *                 printk("got input data from user-space: %.*s", size, buf);
 *                 return 0;
 *         } else {
 *                 return snprintf("hello from kernel-space!\n");
 *         }
 * }
 *
 * tfw_debugfs_bind("/foo/bar", my_io_handler);
 *
 * The code binds the file /foo/bar with the function my_io_handler() and allows
 * to interact with the kernel function from a user-space shell like this:
 *   $ cat /sys/kernel/debug/tempesta/foo/bar
 *   hello from kernel-space!
 *   $ echo "hi from user-space" > /sys/kernel/debug/tempesta/foo/bar
 *   $ dmesg | head -n1
 *   got input data from user-space: hi from user-space
 *
 * When the file is open()'ed in read mode, the my_io_handler() is called with
 * is_input=false. In this case the function is requested to put some data to
 * the buffer. The buffer then is saved and returned to user-space during
 * subsequent read() calls until the file is close()'d.
 *
 * When the file is open()'ed in write mode, the data is accumulated in the
 * buffer during write() calls. When the file is close()'d, the my_io_handler()
 * is called to take the data received from user-space.
 *
 * Therefore, the handler function doesn't need to care about streaming, it
 * receives or sends the data "atomically" with a single big chunk.
 * This approach simplifies your code (no need to preserve state between calls),
 * but it is not very effective, so don't use it for large amounts of data.
 *
 * @return A status code: 0 if the file is created, -1 otherwise.
