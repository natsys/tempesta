 * This function is called for each incoming HTTP request, so it is relatively
 * performance critical. Therefore, a bunch of optimizations is used to reduce
 * the overhead and that imposes certain effects:
 *
 *  - Each CPU has its own "current" server, so the sequence of servers is
 *    broken when you switch to another CPU. On average, messages are still
 *    distributed equally across the servers, but you can't rely on the order.
 *
 *  - The function intended for use from a softirq context, it uses per-CPU
 *    variables and busy-waiting without disabling the preemption or perform
 *    any locking (although it is safe to call it with preemption enabled - you
 *    get a wasted CPU time slice in a worst case).
 *
 *  - The function assumes that add() doesn't add NULL elements to the list
 *    and del() sets deleted elements to NULL. If this invariant is violated,
 *    it may lock up the system or return a pointer to deleted server.
